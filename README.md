# ECE5275 Final Project: Look That Way!
## Nathan Rakhlin (npr29) and Nicholas Papapanou (ngp37)

Copy the look_that_way_game folder into your /home/pi directory.
Configure your RPi to autologin and bootup on your PiTFT with no keyboard, mouse, or monitor attached.
Make sure that the USB camera is hooked up to the front top left USB port (see report for pictures).

To run the game via SSH, run the following command in the terminal:

sudo -E sh /home/pi/look_that_way_game/game.sh

Enjoy our game!
